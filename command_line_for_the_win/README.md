# Command line for the win

Background Context
CMD CHALLENGE is a pretty cool game challenging you on Bash skills. Everything is done via the command line and the questions are becoming increasingly complicated. It’s a good training to improve your command line skills!

This project is NOT mandatory at all. It is 100% optional. Have fun!

Requirements

General
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
This project will be manually reviewed.
As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green
A screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels
Push this screenshot with the right name to GitHub, in either the PNG or JPEG format

Specific

In addition to completing the project tasks and submitting the required screenshots to GitHub, you are also required to demonstrate the use of the SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) command-line tool to move your local screenshots to the sandbox environment.

Here are the steps I followed:

- I took the screenshots of the completed levels as mentioned in the general requirements.
- I opened a terminal or command prompt on my local machine, I used Git Bash by the way.
- I used the SFTP command-line tool to establish a connection to the sandbox environment. This required hostname, username, and password provided to for the sandbox environment.
- Once connected, I navigated to the directory where I want to upload the screenshots.
- I used the SFTP put command to upload the screenshots from local machine to the sandbox environment.
- I confirmed that the screenshots have been successfully transferred by checking the sandbox directory.
- Once the screenshots were transferred, I proceeded to push the screenshots to GitHub as mentioned in the initial requirements.

NOTE :

The screenshoots of completed level are inside the dir /root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/
